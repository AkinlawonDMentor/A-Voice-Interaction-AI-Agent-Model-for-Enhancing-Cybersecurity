# AI-Agent-Model-for-Cybersecurity-Voice-Interaction-
The rapid evolution of cyber threats has placed enormous pressure on Security Operations Centers (SOCs) to detect, analyze, and respond to incidents in real time. So far, the traditional workflows rely heavily on manual typing, dashboard navigation, and repetitive querying of logs or threat intelligence feeds. These approaches are often slow, error-prone, and inaccessible to analysts who need hands-free interaction.

This research project proposes an AI Agent Model for Cybersecurity powered by Voice Interaction. It integrates speech recognition, natural language understanding, orchestration, and text-to-speech to create a seamless, safe, and efficient way for analysts to interact with cybersecurity systems.

Project Description

The proposed model enables analysts to issue voice commands such as:

“Isolate host 192.168.1.10 for suspicious behavior.”

“Enrich IP 185.199.110.157 against threat intel feeds.”

“Query last 24 hours of failed logins from the SIEM.”

These spoken instructions are transcribed via Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), processed by a Large Language Model (LLM) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and converted into structured JSON function calls. Before execution, the system validates the request, requires approval for high-risk actions, and returns a spoken confirmation to the analyst using Text-to-Speech (TTS).

The architecture designed is modular, ensuring integration with SOAR, SIEM, EDR, and firewall platforms, enabling both read-only queries and actionable responses.
