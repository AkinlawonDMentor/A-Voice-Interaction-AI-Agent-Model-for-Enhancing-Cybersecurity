# AI-Agent-Model-for-Cybersecurity-Voice-Interaction-
The rapid evolution of cyber threats has placed enormous pressure on Security Operations Centers (SOCs) to detect, analyze, and respond to incidents in real time. So far, the traditional workflows rely heavily on manual typing, dashboard navigation, and repetitive querying of logs or threat intelligence feeds. These approaches are often slow, error-prone, and inaccessible to analysts who need hands-free interaction.

This research project proposes an AI Agent Model for Cybersecurity powered by Voice Interaction. It integrates speech recognition, natural language understanding, orchestration, and text-to-speech to create a seamless, safe, and efficient way for analysts to interact with cybersecurity systems.

Project Description

The proposed model enables analysts to issue voice commands such as:

“Isolate host 192.168.1.10 for suspicious behavior.”

“Enrich IP 185.199.110.157 against threat intel feeds.”

“Query last 24 hours of failed logins from the SIEM.”

These spoken instructions are transcribed via Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), processed by a Large Language Model (LLM) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and converted into structured JSON function calls. Before execution, the system validates the request, requires approval for high-risk actions, and returns a spoken confirmation to the analyst using Text-to-Speech (TTS).

The architecture designed is modular, ensuring integration with SOAR, SIEM, EDR, and firewall platforms, enabling both read-only queries and actionable responses.

Purpose of the Research

The project is designed to:

Enhance SOC efficiency – Reduce the cognitive and manual workload for analysts.

Accelerate response time – Enable immediate voice-driven commands for critical incidents.

Ensure safety and compliance – Implement approval flows, schema validation, and audit logs.

Improve accessibility – Allow inclusive participation of analysts who cannot use keyboards effectively.

Bridge AI and cybersecurity – Showcase how conversational AI can be responsibly integrated into high-stakes security domains.

Benefits in Today’s Security World

The benefits of this approach are particularly relevant in the current cybersecurity landscape:

Reduced Mean Time to Respond (MTTR): Fast, voice-based automation significantly cuts response delays.

Operational Efficiency: Analysts spend less time typing and more time analyzing threats.

Error Reduction: Structured AI-driven parsing avoids misconfigurations.

Scalability: Can integrate with multiple back-end systems (e.g., SIEM, SOAR, threat intelligence).

Future-Readiness: Voice-first cybersecurity aligns with broader AI adoption trends in enterprise IT.

Case Study: Applying Voice-Interactive AI Agent to Real Log Data
1. Case Context

The uploaded secure.log contains authentication records (login attempts, failures, possible brute force activity, and system access logs). Such logs are critical in incident detection and response within SOC operations. However, manually parsing these logs is time-consuming and error-prone, especially under attack scenarios.


<br><br>






<br><br>


2. Problem Statement

Traditional log analysis requires analysts to:

Write queries manually (grep, awk, SIEM queries).

Sift through thousands of lines to find anomalies.

Correlate events across multiple systems manually.

This leads to delayed detection of brute force attacks, privilege escalations, and unauthorized logins.

Applying the AI Voice Agent


<br><br>


<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="AI voice" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cfab6fd0-cdaf-48d0-950f-8ebd711b13fb" />

Using the AI Agent Model, an analyst could simply issue voice queries such as:

“Show me all failed SSH login attempts in the last 24 hours.”

“Summarize suspicious IP addresses trying to log in repeatedly.”

“Isolate the host if more than 10 failed logins from the same IP are detected.”

Workflow with secure.log data:

Voice Command: Analyst issues spoken request.

ASR (WhisperX): Converts voice to transcript.

LLM (GPT-4o + RAG): Interprets intent → maps to query pattern for log parsing.

Orchestration Layer: Executes the query on secure.log.

Detection: Finds repeated failed SSH attempts from specific IPs (potential brute force).

Action: With approval, isolates the suspicious host or blocks the IP.

Response: AI Agent summarizes verbally → “Host 192.168.1.24 attempted 25 failed logins within 2 minutes. Action taken: Host isolated.”

Case Study Findings
1. Overall Statistics

Total Failed Login Attempts: 8,728

Total Successful Logins: 445

Total Invalid User Attempts: 0

2. Top IPs with Failed Attempts

87.194.216.51 → 272 failed logins

128.241.220.82 → 160 failed logins

109.169.32.135 → 153 failed logins

216.221.226.11 → 151 failed logins

194.215.205.19 → 145 failed logins

 These are highly suspicious, potentially brute-force attempts.

3. Suspicious IPs (More than 5 failed logins)

208.240.243.170 → 67 attempts

211.166.11.101 → 136 attempts

201.42.223.29 → 91 attempts

27.101.11.11 → 95 attempts

233.77.49.94 → 82 attempts

95.130.170.231 → 98 attempts

…and many more flagged with 30–200+ failed attempts each.

This suggests coordinated brute-force or botnet activity.

4. Successful Login Sources

10.3.10.46 → 259 successful logins

10.2.10.163 → 137 successful logins

10.1.10.172 → 49 successful logins

 These are internal IPs (10.x.x.x range), likely legitimate users in the network.

Voice Agent Response (Example)


<br><br>

If an analyst asked:
“Summarize suspicious login activity in the last 24 hours.”

The AI Agent would reply:

“There were 8,728 failed login attempts and 445 successful logins. The most suspicious IP is 87.194.216.51 with 272 failed attempts, followed by 128.241.220.82 and 109.169.32.135. Multiple IPs exceeded 50 failed attempts, indicating possible brute-force activity. Internal users at 10.3.10.46 and 10.2.10.163 had the most successful logins.”

Findings (Illustrative from Secure Logs)

Multiple repeated failed login attempts detected (pattern of brute force).

Certain IP addresses attempting unauthorized access.

Potential need for account lockout policies or fail2ban-style rules.





<br><br>




 Benefits of Voice-Interactive Analysis

Speed: Immediate detection without manually combing logs.

Clarity: AI summarizes findings in natural language.

Actionability: Direct orchestration of responses (blocking IPs, isolating hosts).
